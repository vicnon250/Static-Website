	You can scroll down to your home state to quickly direct you to thet states voting registration site.
	<br><br>
	Note: You may register to vote in any state you are currently living in, so if your campus is not in your home state or even in your home city. 
	You may register with your current address for convineient voting. Registering to vote with an adress you will not be in this November
	will make your polling site close to the adress your registered.

	<b>2) Since states are in charge of their own elections, states may require different processes to become register.</b> This website will walk you through what is needed to either
	register online or through mail. As well as include deadlines for registration. If your state allows for online registration using the National Voter Registration Form,
	vote.org will prompt you to fill it out. Take a look:

		Some states require mail in registration for first time voters.

		vote.org has many other options added than just voting. In our political process we also use a decennial survey
		to record the state of the US population. 2020 is a census year where the information recorded is used for congress 
		reappotionment and the distribution of federal funds, grants and support to states, counties and communities.
		The last page is focused on the census.
